### Spended time & quite inaccurate retrospective:

* 14 mar (few hours codding ~ 2) - project created/determinig app architecture 
* 19 mar (few hours codding ~ 2-3) - addind models/tests
* 20 mar - adding controllers
* 21 mar - migrating/install vue
* 22 mar - ... added vue pages (P.S. not sure)
* 24 mar - controller tests/question notification
* 25 mar - admin dashboard/reply notification

### instead conclusion
A lot of refactoring is requirered, code have been writen in lil rush due to incorrect task time estimation.
Basic fuctions present, test coverage leaves a lot to be desired. Efficiency was sacrified for the functionality.
